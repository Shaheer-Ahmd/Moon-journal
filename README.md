The automation of the moon journal can be broken down in three tasks:
1- Downloading the images of the moon at different dates
2- Finding moon's position at different times on different days
3- Pasting the moon images at their location on a template image.

Task 1 is being done in the file "download_images.py", Task 2 in "moon_position.py" and Task 3 in "main_self.py".

Python Features Used:
- Selenium (to automatically open websites and fetch data)
- Pillow (python image processing library)
